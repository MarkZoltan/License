Iris Recognition using Neural Networks

The performance of biometrics has increased steadily over time. Biometric Iris recognition technology has become widely used for many security applications at a very large scale. The main advantages of recognizing the iris, the visible spectrum, include the possibility of imaging the iris in proximity or distance scenarios. In this paper we propose a new use of this biometric iris recognition technology. The paper consists of a short system that works on the biometric technology mentioned above. This paper is composed of two main components: the eye detection part that is made in the C ++ programming language, and the second part is the realization of a neural network in the Python programming language.
